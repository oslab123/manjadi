Consider the following schema for a LibraryDatabase:
BOOK (Book_id, Title, Publisher_Name, Pub_Year)
BOOK_AUTHORS (Book_id, Author_Name)
PUBLISHER (Name, Address, Phone) 
BOOK_COPIES(Book_id, Branch_id, No-of_Copies)
BOOK_LENDING (Book_id, Branch_id, Card_No, Date_Out, Due_Date)
LIBRARY_BRANCH (Branch_id, Branch_Name, Address)
Write SQL queries to
1. Retrieve details of all books in the library â€“ id, title, name of publisher, authors, number of copies in each branch,etc.
2. Get the particulars of borrowers who have borrowed more than 5 books, but from Jan 2022 to Jun2022
3.List all the books have more than 5 copies in descending order. 
4. Create a view of all books and its number of copies that are currently available in the Library.

Write a PL/SQL program to display Title, Publisher name and Publishing year using cursor.
